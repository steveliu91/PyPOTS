        Put all important information relative to the new model, e.g. paper link, citation number, and why you think it is necessary for PyPOTS to include.

          Please note that if the model's open-source implementation is not available, it'll take much more time to finish the implementation, so we are less likely to implement it in `PyPOTS`.
